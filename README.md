# Abstract

Since the first blockchain-based Decentralized Finance (DeFi) went online on the Ethereum
main net in 2017, DeFi Ecosystems have reached their peak in Total Value Locked (TVL)
of 258 billion USD. At the time of writing, although the market has been observing a bear
market, TLV in DeFi protocols has been very stable with protocols in two Ethereum Virtual
Maschine (EVM) compatible blockchains hold more than 60% of the market, Ethereum (33
billion USD, 52.94%) and BNB Smart Chain (4,475 billion USD, 7.17%). DeFi introduces a
variety of protocols inspired by traditional finance, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, lending
platforms, and derivatives. Additionally, it introduces innovative concepts like flash loans and
atomic composability in DeFi trading. Considering DeFi protocolsâ€™ transparency, they are prone
to many exploitations from adversaries with monetary motives. Thus, an interesting question
arises: Would the adversaries have been able to take advantage of the protocols differently using
different strategies?

For this thesis, we have conducted a comprehensive dataset of 147 high-impact real-world DeFi
incidents on Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain from May 01, 2022, to Oct 31, 2023, in which
period the reported damage value amounted to over 1 billion USD. The analysis is supported
by a State-of-the-Art Smart Contract fuzzer, which suggests that some of the attack strategies
are only sub-optimal. Finally, based on our calculation using the dataset, we conclude that the
rescue time frame for the defending party in a smart contract attack has decreased compared
to prior years.
